									<div class="animate__animated animatethis">
								<p>Cocoa is central to the livelihoods of nearly 350,000 cocoa farmers in Mars’s global supply chain. Many cocoa farming families and their communities struggle to thrive as they face socio-economic challenges such as poverty, structural inequalities, and lack of access to the tools and financial capital that could improve their circumstances.</p>
<p>This drives Mars to strive to create a sustainable cocoa supply chain and to meaningfully improve the lives of cocoa farming families so that they thrive and have the resources available to reduce the environmental impact of cocoa production. Currently, roughly three-quarters of Mars’s GHG emissions comes from the agricultural practices and land-use change associated with growing the ingredients Mars needs to make their products. The company has a global commitment to achieving net zero across its entire value chain by 2050.</p>

									<div class="animate__animated animatethis">
								<p>Mars is accelerating the transformation of the cocoa ecosystem in an effort to make it more modern, inclusive and sustainable—to help people and the planet thrive. This means helping create an ecosystem where no one is left behind—working toward systemic solutions that tackle structural issues holding back progress—including everything from access to finances and women’s empowerment to working with farming families on climate-smart agricultural practices.</p>
<p>All this supports Mars’s aim to have 100% of its cocoa responsibly sourced, traceable from farm to first point of purchase, and deforestation-free by 2025.</p>
<p>To prevent cases of forced and child labour in cocoa production for the long term, solutions must tackle the root causes. In this regard, Mars is taking action in the relevant areas of increased income, access to quality education, and women’s social and economic empowerment.</p>

It was concluded that the longer-term, often overlooked and neglected “mainstreaming” work of changing mindsets and social norms is essential if we want to make meaningful progress in lowering barriers to equality, reducing poverty and unlocking the full potential of women and girls. Mars is taking action by embedding a gender transformative lens into its cocoa policies, strategies, partnerships and programmes linked to human rights, the environment and farmer income.</p>

By entering a long term agreement in connection with the venture, Mars Wrigley will help it achieve financial stability and scale. “This groundbreaking partnership will&#8230;bolster climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity enhancement, people’s well-being and smallholder initiatives,” says Xavier Sagnieres, an executive of 12Tree and chief executive of Andean Cacao.</p>

								<p>The project will use agroforestry, precision agriculture and tailored irrigation systems to generate healthy, vibrant soil and sequester carbon on almost 3,000 hectares of degraded cattle pastureland, uniting 12Tree’s expertise in transforming land, ECOM’s experience of managing agricultural commodities in Latin America, and Mars Wrigley’s 30-plus years of research and innovation in cocoa agronomy. “I’m excited about the knowledge we’ll gather through the Andean Cacao venture to apply the best of modern sustainable cocoa farming elsewhere,” says Amber Johnson, global vice-president of Cocoa Enterprise at Mars Wrigley.</p>
<p>Andean Cacao has already created more than 250 long-term jobs (at least 25% filled by women) and includes more than 200 smallholder farmers in its network, helping them achieve greater yields and higher price points by providing technical assistance, transportation and capacity building programmes for farmers.</p>
<p>On the environmental front, in just over two years, Andean Cacao has increased by 14% the organic matter content in the soil through regenerative practices and cocoa agroforestry design, which will contribute to increase carbon sequestration, aiding in the company’s journey to produce climate-smart cocoa.</p>

									<div class="animate__animated animatethis">
								<p>For farms to support families across multiple generations, they must also be managed efficiently.</p>
<p>Through its Innovating Sustainable Smallholder Cocoa Farming programme, Mars aims to deploy initiatives to help reshape the cocoa supply chain in the long term by speeding up modernisation and developing a model that enables cocoa farming families to increase their income.</p>
<p>These initiatives include further innovation in sustainable family farming through bundles of interventions focused on personalised farm coaching, strengthened farmer market power through co-operatives, farmer groups and access to market, and helping farming families develop multi-year farm and household business plans that include diversified incomes so that families have resilient means to improve their livelihoods.</p>
<p>A centrepiece of this work is cocoa coaching, which involves creating networks of trained farmers who can coach others to improve productivity. The story of Pak Alexander, a farmer and “cocoa doctor” from Indonesia, shows how the Mars-driven initiative can help transform farmers’ futures.</p>

								<p>Alexander’s father gave him the plot to manage when he first returned to the family business, but the land was in “terrible condition”, which affected his income. After hearing about the cocoa coaching programme from an uncle, Alexander spent four weeks learning about farming techniques and how to run a business.</p>
<p>The results were life-changing. “I was able to triple my yield, and now I’m helping other cocoa farmers be as productive,” says Alexander. The family’s income from farming alone increased nearly tenfold, and since the days when he left to work elsewhere, his view of the family’s legacy has turned around. “I want my children to continue running the farm when they grow up,” he says.</p>

								<p>Others in the area are also optimistic with Alexander behind them. “It’s people like him who help the young adults of this village in farming cocoa,” says Masnawati, also a cocoa farmer. “Cocoa promises so much for our future,” she says.</p>
<p>Masnawati’s hopeful assessment suggests that the Cocoa for Generations strategy is bearing fruit. But more remains to be done. “To create meaningful change across the industry, like farmers moving out of poverty, increased cohesion across the business, government and civil society groups is needed, combining expertise and collectively stepping up efforts,” says Johnson.</p>

								<p><strong>Next steps for sustainable cocoa</strong></p>
<p>In April 2022, Mars announced the next step in its efforts to transform the cocoa ecosystem, with programmes in Côte d’Ivoire and Indonesia to support 14,000 smallholder farmers who are building a path to sustainable living income over the next eight years. In conjunction with USAID, the Institute for Development Impact, Fairtrade, co-operatives union ECOOKIM, and others, the effort seeks to address challenges created by market failures and climate change by bundling interventions around credit and financial inclusion, agroforestry and income diversification; helping to create the conditions in which families with small cocoa farms can lift themselves out of poverty.</p>
<p>The plan draws on insights from the Farmer Income Lab’s research and Mars’s existing programmes in other raw ingredients. Mars’s Shubh Mint project covers 20,000 small farms in Uttar Pradesh, India, and led to a boost in crop net income of over 250%. In Côte d’Ivoire, the Livelihood Ecosystem Advancement Program (LEAP) will aim to help more than 70% of the 5,000 participating farmers achieve a living income by 2030, which translates to income growth of more than 100% for most households involved. In Indonesia, the Advancing Cocoa Agroforestry Towards Income, Value and Environmental Sustainability alliance (ACTIVE) aims to promote cocoa agroforestry projects that address climate change mitigation and adaptation, while improving livelihoods for smallholder farmers.</p>
